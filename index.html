    <h2>Work experience</h2>
    <h3>Harwoods (2022 - 2023)</h3>
        <p>My last employment was as a contact centre executive dealing with 
        inbound/outbound calls, emails and a diary on a day-to-day basis. 
        My main focus was to book customer cars in for MOT, service or any 
        other issues. I do this using a system called pinnacle. I used MDF 
        for my outbound calls and diary for the day depending on what site 
        and type of vehicle it is. I sent out emails to customers for a variety 
        of reason, they may want quote for a service or they may want confirmation
        to a booking or to book in with me at a later date. I enjoy learning new
        things like all the systems for this job and a passion to learn more to
        provide exceptional service. Throughout this job, I have learnt more 
        systems that I did not know before, like pinnacle and I have put my 
        problem-solving skills to good use to handle complex customer enquiries.</p>

    <h3>Turtle Beach (2021-2022)</h3>
        <p>As a customer service advisor, I dealt with inbound emails about 
            customers orders. I would find out what stage deliveries were using 
            systems like NetSuite, Salesforce and a payment system which had the
            tracking information on. Depending on the issue, I would need to 
            contact external businesses like Royal Mail or yodel via email. 
            The system that I used to email the customers was Salesforce. 
            Throughout this job, I learnt how to write professional emails 
            to internal and external contacts with a great attention to detail 
            as I would need to know where the parcel is. I was selected to 
            gather the information for the audit for that year of business.</p>

    <h3>Reading Borough Council (Temp Job 1 Month 2020)</h3>
        <p>I was a customer service advisor dealing with the Green 
            Bins Subscription taking calls to either sort out the 
            renewal or a problem with paying online. Using systems 
            like Civica App, Webpay, whitespace and firm step and 
            Academy. Civica APP used to request bins or bags and any 
            general enquiries the customer had. Webpay took the payment 
            for the subscription and the bins/bags. Whitespace is the 
            bin system to check the customer’s account. Firm step is the 
            application form that you need to fill out to get the subscription.
            Lastly, academy is used to check the council tax system. 
            For this job, I wrote a PowerPoint presentation, for the new
            starters to enable them to perform the role. I learnt a lot 
            of new systems and a lot of new administrative jobs like emails
            and filling in online paperwork. </p>

    <h3>Creditlink Account Recovery Solution (2018 - 2019)</h3>
        <p>As a collector, I dealt with inbound and outbound calls 
            from customers and clients. The job involved customer 
            service where I helped customers with making payments or
            taking arrangements to make payments. It included helping 
            resolve customers problems myself or referring them to the 
            relevant department. Every day, I had a diary which meant 
            calling customers to make payments, sorting accounts out 
            so that we can continue chase for payments or calling the 
            client to see if they have resolved the complaint or dispute.
            Every month, I received feedback from my supervisor on what 
            I did well that month and what I can improve on. I received 
            targets for the next month and how I am going to achieve those
            targets. This job taught me a lot about meeting deadlines with
            not a lot of time to do it in. Finally, it showed me how to 
            talk to people on the phone in a professional manner.</p>
